With years of experience turning perfectly good requirements into  beautifully broken applications, I specialize in creating bugs that are so creative, they should win awards. My superpower is writing code that works on my machine but mysteriously fails everywhere else. I have an unhealthy relationship with Stack Overflow and consider \"Did you try turning it off and on again?\" as a valid debugging strategy.\n"
